Possible Idea:
Have the program run in Scheme due to its ability to crunch large numbers quickly and efficiently with recursion, 
Have the Scheme program write the graph points to a file, or have the outputs piped directly into a Python script.
The Python script then graphs the set, utilizing Pythons graphing libraries (matplotlib, etc)

It would be nice and efficient to pipe the output/math/graph points directly into the Python graphing script.
It would also be nice for the Scheme code directly call the Python script, but I'm not sure if it has that capacity. 


HTDP (How to design programs) - R5RS language but does graphics. Could replace Python for graphing
